        </header>

        <article class="prose-content">
            <p>Last month I went down a rabbit hole.</p>
            <p>I downloaded every fretboard training app I could find. Paid ones, free ones, the ones with thousands of
                reviews and the sketchy ones with twelve downloads. I wanted to know what's actually out there — what
                works, what's overhyped, and what's just trying to squeeze money out of frustrated guitarists.</p>
            <p>Here's my brutally honest breakdown.</p>

            <h2>Fretonomy — The Feature-Packed Giant</h2>
            <p>Let's start with the big one. Fretonomy is probably the most recommended fretboard app in guitar forums.
                And honestly? It deserves the hype. Mostly.</p>
            <p><strong>What's good:</strong> This thing has everything. Scales, chords, intervals, ear training. There's
                a heat map that shows you which notes you're struggling with. The interface looks professional. It feels
                like a real product, not someone's weekend project.</p>
            <p><strong>What's annoying:</strong> It's... a lot. Like, almost too much. You open the app wanting to do a
                quick five-minute drill and suddenly you're lost in seventeen different menus. Some people love having
                all those options. I found it overwhelming when I just wanted to practice note locations.</p>
            <p>And then there's the money thing. The free version basically locks you out of anything useful past the
                first few frets. Want the full fretboard? That's a subscription. For what is essentially a flashcard
                app.</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Great if you want a complete theory suite and don't mind paying. Overkill if
                you just want to drill notes.</p>

            <h2>JustinGuitar Note Trainer — The Friendly Guide</h2>
            <p>Justin Sandercoe is a legend. His free YouTube lessons have taught more people guitar than probably any
                music school. So expectations were high for his app.</p>
            <p><strong>What's good:</strong> Super beginner-friendly. The interface is clean, nothing confusing. If
                you're following his structured course, this app fits right into that ecosystem.</p>
            <p><strong>What's annoying:</strong> It's paid. And if you're not already in the JustinGuitar universe, the
                app feels a bit restrictive. It really wants you to follow his specific progression.</p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Perfect for beginners doing the JustinGuitar course. Less ideal if you're
                intermediate and just want a standalone tool.</p>

            <h2>Web-Based Tools (FaChords, Guitar Orb)</h2>
            <p>There's a whole category of browser-based fretboard trainers. No download, just open and go.</p>
            <p><strong>What's good:</strong> The convenience is unbeatable. No app store, no updates, no storage space.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What's annoying:</strong> Here's the big one — none of them have microphone input. You're
                clicking or tapping your answers, not actually playing guitar. It's more like a quiz than real practice.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Good for quick mental quizzes. But the lack of actual playing integration is a
                pretty big gap.</p>

            <h2>The Thing Nobody's Doing</h2>
            <p>So after all this testing, here's what I noticed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile apps with microphone detection?</strong> Plenty. But they all want your money, and
                    you're stuck downloading another app.</li>
                <li><strong>Free web tools you can use instantly?</strong> Sure. But no microphone. You're not really
                    playing.</li>
                <li><strong>A web-based tool with mic detection that's actually free?</strong> Basically nobody.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That gap is exactly why I built FretMemo.</p>

            <h2>Where FretMemo Fits</h2>
            <p>I'm not gonna pretend FretMemo does everything. It doesn't teach you chord theory. It won't explain the
                circle of fifths.</p>
            <p>Here's what it does:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Works in your browser.</strong> No download, no account, no "allow notifications?" popups.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Has microphone detection.</strong> Actually play the notes on your guitar. It listens and
                    checks if you're right.</li>
                <li><strong>Also works without mic.</strong> On the bus? Use it as a mental flashcard trainer.</li>
                <li><strong>Actually free.</strong> Not "free trial." Not "first 5 frets free." The whole thing. No ads.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Should Use What</h2>
            <p><strong>You're a total beginner and want structure:</strong> JustinGuitar, probably. His whole system is
                built for you.</p>
            <p><strong>You want ALL the features and theory tools:</strong> Fretonomy. Just budget for the subscription.
            </p>
            <p><strong>You want quick, no-friction drilling on any device:</strong> That's what I built FretMemo for.
                Open, practice, close. Done.</p>

            <p>If that sounds good to you, give FretMemo a shot. If not, hey, at least now you know what else is out
                there.</p>
