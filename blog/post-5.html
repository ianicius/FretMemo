        </header>

        <article class="prose-content">
            <p>I'm gonna tell you something that might sting a little.</p>
            <p>That scale you've been practicing? The one you can play perfectly at 120 BPM without even thinking? You
                probably didn't learn as much from it as you think you did.</p>
            <p>I know. I've been there. You run through C major ten times, nail it every time, feel like a champion.
                Except... two weeks later you're trying to improvise over a backing track and you can't find the D.</p>
            <p>You got really good at the pattern. But you never actually learned the notes.</p>

            <h2>The Practice Trap (Blocked vs Interleaved)</h2>
            <p>There's this concept in learning science that changed how I think about practice. Researchers call it
                "blocked practice" versus "interleaved practice."</p>
            <p><strong>Blocked practice</strong> is what most of us do naturally. You pick one thing and repeat it over
                and over.</p>
            <p>It feels productive. By rep number fifteen, you're faster and smoother than rep number one.</p>
            <p>Here's the problem: it's kind of an illusion. Your brain is optimizing for that specific sequence. It
                stops treating each note as a decision and starts running the whole thing as one automated chunk.</p>

            <h2>The Frustrating Method That Actually Works</h2>
            <p><strong>Interleaved practice</strong> is the opposite. You mix everything up. Random order. No
                predictable patterns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find Bb on the D string</li>
                <li>Now find F# on the A string</li>
                <li>Now E on the G string</li>
                <li>Now back to C but on a different string</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And honestly? It feels terrible.</p>
            <p>You're slower. You make more mistakes. But research shows the person doing interleaved practice will
                remember more a week later.</p>

            <h2>Your Brain Needs Resistance</h2>
            <p>There's a term researchers use: "desirable difficulty."</p>
            <p>When learning feels too easy, your brain kind of checks out. That moment when you're staring at the
                fretboard thinking "wait, where the hell is Eb?" — that's your brain actually working. That pause, that
                search, that little bit of frustration? That's deep encoding happening.</p>

            <h2>Why It Feels Like You're Getting Worse</h2>
            <p>When you switch from blocked to interleaved practice, you will feel like you've regressed. Your brain
                will scream at you. "This isn't working! Go back to the old way!"</p>
            <p>Ignore it. That feeling of fluency during blocked practice is misleading. Researchers actually call it
                the "illusion of competence."</p>

            <h2>How I Use This</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warmup (5 min):</strong> Regular scale stuff. Get the fingers moving.</li>
                <li><strong>Random drilling (10-15 min):</strong> This is where the real learning happens. Notes come at
                    me with no pattern. It's slow and annoying. That's how I know it's working.</li>
                <li><strong>Actual playing (however long):</strong> Songs, improvisation, whatever. The fun part.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Embrace the chaos. </p>
