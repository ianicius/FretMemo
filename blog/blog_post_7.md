# The Spider Walk Is Just the Beginning: 5 Technique Exercises That Actually Make You a Better Player

I have a confession.

For years, my "technique practice" consisted of exactly one exercise: the spider walk. You know the one. 1-2-3-4 up the fretboard, back down, maybe with Netflix on in the background. Ten minutes of finger aerobics, then on to the fun stuff.

And look — the spider walk isn't bad. It's the guitar equivalent of stretching before a run. It gets blood flowing, loosens up the fingers, builds some basic coordination.

But here's what I eventually realized: the spider walk has some serious blind spots.

It only moves across adjacent strings. It only uses one finger pattern. Your picking hand barely has to aim. And your brain? Completely checked out after the third repetition.

I was getting really good at one very specific movement that almost never happens in actual music.

So I went looking for exercises that would fill in the gaps. Exercises that felt *similar* to spider walk — pattern-based, metronome-friendly, measurable progress — but that trained different skills.

After a lot of experimenting (and some cramped hands), I found five that actually made a noticeable difference in my playing. Now they're all in FretMemo's Technique mode. Here's what each one does and why it matters.

## 1. Permutation Trainer: Break Your Fingers Free

Here's a weird fact about your hand: your ring and middle fingers share a tendon. That's why when you lift one, the other wants to follow along like a clingy friend.

The spider walk doesn't fix this. It actually makes it worse.

Think about it: in the 1-2-3-4 pattern, your fingers always move in the same order. Index leads, middle follows, ring comes next, pinky trails behind. Your brain learns to fire them as a sequence, not as independent digits.

This creates what guitarists call "sympathetic movement" — your fingers moving together when you want them to move separately. It's the reason chord changes feel clunky and fast passages turn into mush.

**The fix: Permutation training.**

There are 24 possible ways to arrange four fingers. The spider walk uses exactly one of them. The Permutation Trainer cycles through the rest.

Some patterns feel almost normal: 1-2-4-3 (just swap the last two). Others are brutal: 3-4-2-1 (starting with your ring finger feels like learning guitar again from scratch).

The hardest ones — the "tendon breakers" — are specifically designed to separate fingers that want to stick together. Pattern 1-3-2-4 forces your ring finger to move before your middle finger, which feels completely backwards at first.

But that's the point. Your brain is learning to control each finger independently instead of relying on the comfortable cascade.

**What you'll notice:** After a few weeks, chord changes that used to require conscious effort become smooth. Your fingers start going where you want them to go, not where momentum carries them.

## 2. String Skipping: Teach Your Pick to Aim

The spider walk moves from string 6 to string 5 to string 4, nice and predictable. Your picking hand barely has to move — just tiny adjustments, millimeter by millimeter.

Real music doesn't work that way.

Arpeggios jump around. Pentatonic licks skip strings constantly. That cool octave riff you've been trying to learn? It bounces between the low E and D string, skipping the A entirely.

When your picking hand isn't trained for these jumps, you start hitting wrong strings. Or you slow way down to aim carefully. Neither is great.

**The fix: String skipping exercises.**

These drills force your pick to jump over strings instead of moving adjacently. Play the low E, skip to the D, back to the A, skip to the G. Your picking hand has to actually target each string instead of just drifting to the next one.

The only way to really improve your string skipping is to watch your picking hand while you do it. This is the secret to improving picking hand accuracy. Once you memorize the pattern with your fretting hand, you can stare at your pick and see exactly where it's going wrong.

More importantly, it will also give you a more precise feel for where each string lays in relation to the others and will therefore set you up to perform string skips most efficiently and precisely, resulting in a cleaner picking technique overall.

**What you'll notice:** Arpeggios clean up. Those wide-interval licks that used to trip you up suddenly feel manageable. And weirdly, your regular adjacent-string playing gets cleaner too — because now your pick actually knows where it's going instead of just falling onto the next string.

## 3. Diagonal Patterns: Learn to Shift on the Fly

Spider walk keeps your hand in one position. Play frets 1-2-3-4, move to the next string, same frets. Your hand frame stays static.

But real playing requires constant micro-adjustments. Scale runs that move up the neck. Chord voicings that shift as you cross strings. Melodies that don't stay in one box.

**The fix: Diagonal exercises.**

Instead of playing the same four frets on every string, diagonal patterns shift one fret for each string change. 

- String 6: Fret 1 (index)
- String 5: Fret 2 (middle)  
- String 4: Fret 3 (ring)
- String 3: Fret 4 (pinky)

Then you shift and repeat on the next string group.

This creates a "staircase" motion across the neck. Your hand can't stay locked in place — it has to constantly recalibrate.

The bonus? This pattern is perfect for practicing economy picking or sweeping. Because you're playing one note per string in a consistent direction, you can let your pick "fall through" the strings instead of alternating up-down on each one.

**What you'll notice:** Position shifts become less scary. You stop getting trapped in the same old boxes. Your fretting hand learns to move fluidly up and down the neck instead of just parking somewhere.

## 4. Legato Builder: When Your Pick Stops Helping

Here's something most guitarists don't realize: when you pick every note, your picking hand is doing a lot of the work.

The pick attack provides volume. It provides articulation. It covers up weak fretting.

Legato practice strips all that away.

In hammer-on/pull-off exercises, your fretting fingers have to generate the sound by themselves. No pick to help. If your ring finger can't hammer down hard enough, the note dies. If your pinky can't pull off with enough snap, it's a ghost note.

It develops finger strength, precision, and control for any guitar player.

The most brutal version? Trill exercises between your weakest finger combinations. Middle and ring (the shared-tendon pair). Ring and pinky (the weak link). Hold a trill for 15 seconds and feel muscles in your hand that you didn't know existed.

**What you'll notice:** Your fretting hand gets strong. Like, actually strong. Notes ring cleaner because you're pressing with more control. Fast passages smooth out because you can hammer-on instead of picking every single note. And your overall playing becomes more dynamic — you're not dependent on the pick to make everything sound good.

## 5. Linear Shifter: Stop Getting Trapped in Boxes

Most guitarists practice scales in positions. C major here, A minor pentatonic there. Boxes.

The problem? Real melodies don't respect box boundaries. And when you hit the edge of the pattern you know, you get stuck. You either awkwardly jump to another box or you turn around and go back down.

Linear exercises break that habit.

**The fix: Single-string chromatic runs.**

Play 1-2-3-4 on the low E string. But instead of crossing to the A string, shift your whole hand up one fret and play 2-3-4-5. Shift again. Keep going until you run out of frets.

This forces your entire arm to participate. Shoulder, elbow, wrist — all coordinating to move your hand frame smoothly up (or down) the neck. It's the "shift" mechanism that connects scale positions together.

The variation: try it in groups of 5 or 6 notes before shifting. This creates rhythmic displacement (your accent lands on a different beat each measure) and trains your brain to think beyond four-note groups.

**What you'll notice:** The fretboard stops feeling like isolated islands. You can move fluidly from position to position. That terrifying area above the 12th fret becomes just another part of the neck.

## The "One Exercise to Rule Them All" Trap

I know what some of you are thinking. *"I'll just pick one of these and do that every day."*

Don't.

The whole point is that each exercise targets different weaknesses. Permutations for finger independence. String skipping for pick accuracy. Diagonals for shifting. Legato for strength. Linear for connection.

Do the spider walk AND these. Rotate through them. Spend two minutes on each during warmup. Hit your weak spots harder.

The spider walk got you this far. These exercises get you further.

## The Real Goal: Integration

Here's what nobody told me when I started playing: technique and knowledge aren't separate things. They're the same thing.

When you practice permutations, you're not just building finger independence — you're teaching your fingers to go to specific notes without thinking. When you practice string skipping, you're learning the physical distance between notes on different strings.

The best players don't have "good technique" and "good fretboard knowledge" as separate skills. They have integrated movement and understanding. Their fingers go where the music needs because they've drilled both the physical pattern AND the mental map.

These technique exercises are sneaky that way. They feel like physical training, but they're actually building your mental fretboard at the same time.

Especially if you do them FretMemo-style: with random targets, forcing you to think about where each note lives while your fingers are moving.

That's when the magic happens.
