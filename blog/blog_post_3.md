\# I Tried Every Fretboard App So You Don't Have To (Honest Comparison)



Last month I went down a rabbit hole.



I downloaded every fretboard training app I could find. Paid ones, free ones, the ones with thousands of reviews and the sketchy ones with twelve downloads. I wanted to know what's actually out there — what works, what's overhyped, and what's just trying to squeeze money out of frustrated guitarists.



Here's my brutally honest breakdown.



\## Fretonomy — The Feature-Packed Giant



Let's start with the big one. Fretonomy is probably the most recommended fretboard app in guitar forums. And honestly? It deserves the hype. Mostly.



\*\*What's good:\*\* This thing has everything. Scales, chords, intervals, ear training. There's a heat map that shows you which notes you're struggling with. The interface looks professional. It feels like a real product, not someone's weekend project.



\*\*What's annoying:\*\* It's... a lot. Like, almost too much. You open the app wanting to do a quick five-minute drill and suddenly you're lost in seventeen different menus. Some people love having all those options. I found it overwhelming when I just wanted to practice note locations.



And then there's the money thing. The free version basically locks you out of anything useful past the first few frets. Want the full fretboard? That's a subscription. For what is essentially a flashcard app. I get that developers need to eat, but come on.



Also, multiple people on Reddit complain about crashing after updates. Your mileage may vary.



\*\*Verdict:\*\* Great if you want a complete theory suite and don't mind paying. Overkill if you just want to drill notes.



\## JustinGuitar Note Trainer — The Friendly Guide



Justin Sandercoe is a legend. His free YouTube lessons have taught more people guitar than probably any music school. So expectations were high for his app.



\*\*What's good:\*\* Super beginner-friendly. The interface is clean, nothing confusing. If you're following his structured course, this app fits right into that ecosystem. It holds your hand in a nice way, not a condescending way.



\*\*What's annoying:\*\* It's paid. Which, again, I understand — Justin provides tons of free content elsewhere. But if you're not already in the JustinGuitar universe, the app feels a bit restrictive. It really wants you to follow his specific progression.



I also saw forum posts about audio issues — the microphone detection being picky, sounds cutting out randomly. Seems like it depends heavily on your device.



\*\*Verdict:\*\* Perfect for beginners doing the JustinGuitar course. Less ideal if you're intermediate and just want a standalone tool.



\## Web-Based Tools (FaChords, Guitar Orb, Fretastic)



There's a whole category of browser-based fretboard trainers. No download, just open and go.



\*\*What's good:\*\* The convenience is unbeatable. No app store, no updates, no storage space. FaChords has a decent leaderboard if you're competitive. Guitar Orb has this fun 99-second timed challenge that people seem to love.



\*\*What's annoying:\*\* Here's the big one — none of them have microphone input. You're clicking or tapping your answers, not actually playing guitar. It's more like a quiz than real practice.



And honestly, most of these sites look like they were designed in 2009 and never updated. Functional but not exactly inspiring.



\*\*Verdict:\*\* Good for quick mental quizzes. But the lack of actual playing integration is a pretty big gap.



\## The Thing Nobody's Doing



So after all this testing, here's what I noticed:



\*\*Mobile apps with microphone detection?\*\* Plenty. But they all want your money, and you're stuck downloading another app.



\*\*Free web tools you can use instantly?\*\* Sure. But no microphone. You're not really playing.



\*\*A web-based tool with mic detection that's actually free?\*\* Basically nobody.



That gap is exactly why I built FretMemo.



\## Where FretMemo Fits



I'm not gonna pretend FretMemo does everything. It doesn't teach you chord theory. It won't explain the circle of fifths. It's not gamified with points and badges and cartoon characters.



Here's what it does:



\*\*Works in your browser.\*\* No download, no account, no "allow notifications?" popups. Just open and go.



\*\*Has microphone detection.\*\* Actually play the notes on your guitar. It listens and checks if you're right.



\*\*Also works without mic.\*\* On the bus? In a quiet library? Use it as a mental flashcard trainer. Your choice.



\*\*Automatic tempo increase.\*\* Get faster as you improve. No manual adjustment needed.



\*\*Spider walk exercise.\*\* That boring warmup you've been doing wrong? There's a mode that turns it into actual fretboard learning.



\*\*Actually free.\*\* Not "free trial." Not "first 5 frets free." The whole thing. No ads interrupting your flow either.



I know how that sounds. "Guy who built the thing says his thing is good." Groundbreaking journalism. But I built it because the other options genuinely frustrated me, and I figured other people felt the same way.



\## Who Should Use What



\*\*You're a total beginner and want structure:\*\* JustinGuitar, probably. His whole system is built for you.



\*\*You want ALL the features and theory tools:\*\* Fretonomy. Just budget for the subscription.



\*\*You want quick, no-friction drilling on any device:\*\* That's what I built FretMemo for. Open, practice, close. Done.



\*\*You hate apps and subscriptions and signing up for things:\*\* Same. That's literally why FretMemo is the way it is.



\## One More Thing



I'm not trying to trash other developers. Building apps is hard. Most of these tools have good ideas behind them. I've learned from all of them.



But the guitar learning space has this weird thing where simple tools get bloated with features until they're confusing, and then they lock half of it behind a paywall. Somewhere along the way, "help people learn notes" became "maximize engagement and recurring revenue."



I just wanted something clean. Something that respects your time and doesn't treat you like a wallet with fingers.



If that sounds good to you, give FretMemo a shot. If not, hey, at least now you know what else is out there.
