\# Why Random Practice Feels Harder But Works Better (The Science Behind the Chaos)



I'm gonna tell you something that might sting a little.



That scale you've been practicing? The one you can play perfectly at 120 BPM without even thinking? You probably didn't learn as much from it as you think you did.



I know. I've been there. You run through C major ten times, nail it every time, feel like a champion. Progress! Growth! Mastery!



Except... two weeks later you're trying to improvise over a backing track and you can't find the D. You know it's in there somewhere. You just played it like fifty times. But now, without the familiar pattern to follow, your brain goes blank.



What happened?



You got really good at the pattern. But you never actually learned the notes.



\## The Practice Trap (Blocked vs Interleaved)



There's this concept in learning science that changed how I think about practice. Researchers call it "blocked practice" versus "interleaved practice."



\*\*Blocked practice\*\* is what most of us do naturally. You pick one thing and repeat it over and over. Play the G major scale twenty times. Then switch to A minor. Then maybe some chord changes. Neat, organized blocks of repetition.



It feels productive. You can literally feel yourself getting better within the session. By rep number fifteen, you're faster and smoother than rep number one. That's progress, right?



Here's the problem: it's kind of an illusion.



What's actually happening is your brain is optimizing for that specific sequence. It stops treating each note as a decision and starts running the whole thing as one automated chunk. You're not thinking "G, A, B, C, D..." — you're just executing a motor program. Fingers go brrrr.



And that's fine for that exact pattern. But it doesn't transfer. The knowledge stays locked inside that one sequence instead of becoming flexible, usable understanding.



\## The Frustrating Method That Actually Works



\*\*Interleaved practice\*\* is the opposite. You mix everything up. Random order. No predictable patterns.



Instead of playing C major twenty times, you might practice like this:



\- Find Bb on the D string

\- Now find F# on the A string

\- Now E on the G string

\- Now Ab somewhere, anywhere

\- Now back to C but on a different string than before



There's no logic connecting these. You can't predict what's coming. You can't settle into a groove.



And honestly? It feels terrible.



You're slower. You make more mistakes. You hesitate constantly. After twenty minutes you feel like you've made zero progress. Meanwhile your friend doing blocked practice is ripping through scales like a machine.



But here's what the research shows — and this has been studied extensively in motor learning and music education — the person doing interleaved practice will remember more a week later. And a month later. And they'll be way better at applying that knowledge in new, unpracticed situations.



The struggle is the point.



\## Your Brain Needs Resistance



There's a term researchers use: "desirable difficulty."



When learning feels too easy, your brain kind of checks out. It's not being challenged, so it doesn't bother encoding deeply. It's like reading the same page of a book five times versus being quizzed on it — the quiz feels harder, but you'll remember way more.



That moment when you're staring at the fretboard thinking "wait, where the hell is Eb?" — that's your brain actually working. That pause, that search, that little bit of frustration? That's deep encoding happening.



Every time you have to actively retrieve information instead of just recognizing it in a pattern, you're strengthening the neural pathway to that information. It's like the difference between seeing someone's face and remembering their name versus having their name on a nametag.



Random practice forces retrieval. Blocked practice lets you coast on recognition.



\## Why It Feels Like You're Getting Worse



This is the cruel part.



When you switch from blocked to interleaved practice, you will feel like you've regressed. I'm not exaggerating. You'll go from playing scales smoothly to fumbling around like a beginner.



Your brain will scream at you. "This isn't working! Go back to the old way! We were good at that!"



Ignore it.



That feeling of fluency during blocked practice is misleading. Researchers actually call it the "illusion of competence." You feel like you know something because you can do it right now, in this specific context, with all the cues in place.



Real competence is being able to do it later, in a different context, without the cues. And that's what interleaved practice builds.



\## How I Use This



I'm not saying never practice scales. Scales are useful. Patterns are useful. You need that foundation.



But if your goal is to actually know the fretboard — to be able to find any note without thinking, to improvise freely, to understand what you're playing — you need random drilling in the mix.



Here's what my practice looks like now:



\*\*Warmup (5 min):\*\* Regular scale stuff. Get the fingers moving. Blocked practice is fine here, I just want blood flow.



\*\*Random drilling (10-15 min):\*\* This is where the real learning happens. Notes come at me with no pattern. I find them, play them, move on. It's frustrating and slow and I make mistakes constantly. That's how I know it's working.



\*\*Actual playing (however long):\*\* Songs, improvisation, whatever. The fun part.



The random drilling used to feel like a chore. Now it's the part I trust most. Everything else gives me short-term satisfaction. The randomness gives me long-term results.



\## The Weird Payoff



Here's what surprised me after a few months of this approach.



I started noticing connections I never saw before. "Oh, that Bb on the A string is the same position as the F I always play, just one string over." My brain was building a web of relationships instead of just memorizing isolated spots.



And improvising got easier. Not because I suddenly knew more theory, but because I could actually find the notes I heard in my head. The fretboard stopped being a mystery grid and started being a map I could navigate.



It doesn't happen overnight. And it never feels as satisfying as nailing a scale run perfectly. But it's real progress instead of fake progress.



\## One Last Thought



I think we've been taught to associate smooth, easy practice with good practice. If it feels hard, we must be doing it wrong.



But learning doesn't work that way. The brain needs challenge. It needs uncertainty. It needs to fail and search and struggle a little bit.



So next time you're fumbling through random notes and feeling like an idiot — good. That's the feeling of actual learning.



Embrace the chaos.
