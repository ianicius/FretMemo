            <h1>No Guitar? No Problem. How to Practice Fretboard in Your Head (Anywhere)</h1>
        </header>

        <article class="prose-content">
            <p>"I don't have time to practice." I've said it. You've said it.</p>
            <p>But here's something I discovered: you don't always need the guitar. Some of the most effective fretboard
                work happens entirely in your head.</p>

            <h2>Mental Practice Isn't Woo-Woo Nonsense</h2>
            <p>I was skeptical at first. But studies show that visualizing a skill activates many of the same neural
                pathways as physically performing it.</p>
            <p>Obviously you can't build calluses by thinking about guitar. But fretboard knowledge? Note locations?
                That's mostly a brain game anyway.</p>

            <h2>What Mental Fretboard Practice Looks Like</h2>
            <p>You're on the bus. Pull out your phone, open a random note generator, and start drilling.</p>
            <p><strong>Note appears: "Ab"</strong></p>
            <p>Close your eyes. Picture the fretboard. Where is Ab?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fourth fret, low E string</li>
                <li>Eleventh fret, A string</li>
                <li>Sixth fret, D string</li>
                <li>First fret, G string</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Can you see them? Can you picture your fingers on those positions?</p>

            <h2>The "One String" Method</h2>
            <p>Pick one string. Let's say the A string. Now, without looking anything up, go through every note from the
                open string to the 12th fret.</p>
            <p>Can you do it without hesitating? Can you do it backwards?</p>

            <h2>The "Find It Fast" Game</h2>
            <p>Pick a note. Let's say E. Now mentally race through all six strings: where's E on each one?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low E: open, 12th fret</li>
                <li>A string: 7th fret</li>
                <li>D string: 2nd fret</li>
                <li>G string: 9th fret</li>
                <li>B string: 5th fret</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The "No Time" Excuse Is Dead</h2>
            <p>You probably have more time than you think. It's just scattered in weird pockets throughout your day —
                five minutes here, ten minutes there.</p>
            <p>If you commute thirty minutes each way, that's five hours a week. Five hours of fretboard visualization,
                every week, on top of your regular practice.</p>
            <p>In a few months, you'll know the neck better than people who've played twice as long as you. All without
                touching a guitar.</p>

                people or if I'm just a weirdo on the train visualizing fretboards. Let me know.*</p>
