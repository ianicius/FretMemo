            <h1>Why the Guitar Fretboard Makes No Sense (And It's Not Your Fault)</h1>
        </header>

        <article class="prose-content">
            <p>Let me guess.</p>
            <p>You've been playing for a while now. Maybe a year, maybe five. You can play songs. You can strum chords.
                But somewhere in the back of your head, there's this secret shame you don't talk about.</p>
            <p>You don't actually know where the notes are.</p>
            <p>Stop beating yourself up. It's not you. The guitar fretboard is genuinely, objectively, almost comically
                confusing. And I'm gonna explain exactly why.</p>

            <h2>Piano Players Have It Easy</h2>
            <p>Look at a piano keyboard. White keys, black keys. Everything laid out in a nice straight line. The
                pattern repeats every octave, and you can literally SEE where the notes are based on the black key
                groupings.</p>
            <p>Now look at a guitar.</p>
            <p>Where's C? Well, which C do you want?</p>
            <p>There's one on the A string, third fret. There's another on the D string, tenth fret. And another on the
                G string, fifth fret. That's FIVE different places to play the exact same note.</p>
            <p>This is called isomorphism, and it's the reason guitar is fundamentally harder to navigate than piano. On
                piano, one note = one key. On guitar, one note = like five different spots.</p>

            <h2>The Fretboard Is a Blank Grid of Lies</h2>
            <p>Here's another thing: there are no visual landmarks. On a piano, black keys create a pattern. On guitar?
                Every fret looks identical. Just metal bars, evenly spaced, stretching into infinity.</p>
            <p>Yes, there are dots. But those dots don't mean anything musical. They're just decorations. The dot on
                fret 5 doesn't tell you "this is where A lives on the low E string." It's just a dot.</p>

            <h2>The B String Ruins Everything</h2>
            <p>Okay, here's where it gets really annoying. Guitar is tuned in fourths. Except for the G to B string.</p>
            <p>That one interval is a third. So that scale shape you learned? It shifts by one fret when you cross from
                G to B. It's a design flaw in the instrument, not a flaw in you.</p>

            <h2>Decision Paralysis Is Real</h2>
            <p>You're improvising. You want to play an F. But now you have a choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First fret, low E string</li>
                <li>Third fret, D string</li>
                <li>Tenth fret, G string</li>
                <li>Sixth fret, B string</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All valid. Which one? While your brain is doing this calculation, the music keeps moving.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Helps</h2>
            <p>You can't fix the instrument's design. But you can train your brain to navigate it anyway.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Randomized drilling</strong> — Force your brain to build that mental map through repetition
                    that doesn't let you rely on muscle memory.</li>
                <li><strong>One string at a time</strong> — Learn every note on the low E string until it's automatic.
                    Then A. Then D.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop comparing yourself to pianists</strong> — Seriously. Different instrument, different
                    challenges.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The fact that you can play anything at all on this weird six-stringed contradiction is impressive. Now go
                learn those notes. One random F at a time.</p>
