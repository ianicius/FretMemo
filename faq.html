When you know the notes instantly, you can build chords, understand scales, and improvise freely without guessing. It's the foundation for becoming a more creative and confident musician."

This forces your brain to retrieve information, strengthening neural pathways and making notes learning much faster than passive review."

You can enable the microphone to get real-time feedback. This mode is perfect for connecting theoretical knowledge with physical muscle memory."
